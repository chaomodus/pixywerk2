PixyWerk2 is a site compiler engineered like a metadata-based CMS with a template rendering system. Underneath it uses
Jinja2 templates to provide programmability, and a structured metadata system, along with processors to convert
user-friendly files such as Markdown and RST into HTML with templates.
